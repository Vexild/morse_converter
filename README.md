# morse_converter
Python script for converting morse code into string and vice versa

Simple commandline converter for string -> morse and morse -> string.

**************************

Before running the script make a .txt file with your message in it (string or morse)
This is mandatory for script for now.

Run script with:
```
python converter.py your_message_file.txt output_file_name.txt mode
```
Mode can be either "tomorse" or "tostring"
Don't worry about the output_file_name.txt, it will be created.

After script is done output file can be read from the scripts folder
